What is MapFilter?
------------------

MapFilter is powerful tool to filter associative arrays (maps or hash tables) 
in PHP5.

MapFilter enables to enforce relations between groups of data Keys 
or/and allowed Values and depending Keys from simple Key-based whitelisting 
to more complex structures.

user and programmer documentation.

Use:

phpdoc -c ./phpdoc_user.ini

    To generate UserDocumentation/

phpdoc -c ./phpdoc_programmer.ini
