Manual
------

MapFilter uses doxygen utility to create HTML reference manual dynamically. 
There are three different initialization files to generate user, programmer
and internal documentation.  Programmer documentation contains full
MapFilter package documentation.  Comprehensive documentation including
supporting classes can be found in doc/internal/ directory.

Use:


$ cd docs/
$ doxygen doxygen/user.ini

    To generate doc/user/html/


$ cd docs/
$ doxygen doxygen/programmer.ini

    To generate doc/programmer/html/


$ cd docs/
$ doxygen doxygen/internal.ini

    To generate doc/internal/html/

An on-line documentation can be found at
http://olivergondza.github.com/MapFilter/.

phpdoc can be used as well:

$ cd docs/
$ phpdoc -c phpdoc/user.ini

    To generate doc/user/phpdoc/


$ cd docs/
$ phpdoc -c phpdoc/programmer.ini

    To generate doc/programmer/phpdoc/


$ cd docs/
$ phpdoc -c phpdoc/internal.ini

    To generate doc/internal/phpdoc/
