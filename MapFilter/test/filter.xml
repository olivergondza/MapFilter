<!--
Structure of filter utility

-h and -v are completely optional options (as it use to be).
-c reverses column order
-l reverses line order

-a, reverse character order in whole file.
when -c and -l can occure simultaneously -a is completely incompatible with
other types of modifications.

like (-h and -v are ommited):
  {}
  {-a}
  {-c}
  {-l}
  {-c:-l}
but nothing else
